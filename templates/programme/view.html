      <h1>Programme</h1>
      <p>On {{ site.committee.event_day }} our venue will most likely host {{ num_speakers }} consecutive speakers, each of whom will give a talk on a particular aspect of software and technology. Afterwards we'll be organizing a dinner and drinks if Covid-regulations allow us to do so. There you can connect with our speakers, partners, and each other.
